    Given a binary tree, we need to check it has heap property or not, Binary tree need to fulfill the following two conditions for being a heap –
        1. It should be a complete tree (i.e. all levels except last should be full).
        2. Every node’s value should be greater than or equal to its child node (considering max-heap).
